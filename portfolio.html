        <p class="pic_descr">This was a photoshop excersize where I was trying to emulate water as well as make a tutorial showing how one could create water effects in PhotoShop. I hope to post it at some point in time. <br/><br/>The water is not as dynamic as I would like, but I left it as is for now in hopes that other artist could experiment with the technique and see what they could do. This was painted by hand using multiple layer properties to simulate water.<br/><br/></p>
         <p class="pic_descr">These characters were designed as a branding excersize and were part of our monetization strategy. Players could buy these characters called "Mischiffs" and use them on tournament leaderboards, essentially against as well as to help other players move up in rank on the leaderboard. The design centered around players "feeding" their characters munchies (that they paid for) and then being able to use them to knock other players down a few ranks or boost their friends up a few ranks to win. These were all done in Illustrator and are vector graphics<br/><br/> These characters from top left to right are: Back to School (Disables the ability to use Level Up Mischiffs for the duration of a tournament), Knight Mirror (Protects you from all attack Mischiffs for the duration of a tournament), and Slots a Lot (earned you free Mischiffs when you won him in game)</p>
           <p class="pic_descr">These characters were also called "Mischiffs" and the same premise applies to them. They were essentially used as boosts or power ups to gameify the leaderboard. These were all done in Illustrator and are vector graphics <br/><br/> These characters from top left to right are: Giesha Pointastic (Gives a percentage of the players total points and add it back to the players total), Sophisticat (Takes you up the leaderboard a certain number of levels), Trade Master (Take any 2 Mischiffs that are the same and trade them in for one of higher rarity) and Good Knight (Protects player once against an attack)<br/><br/> </p>
           <p class="pic_descr">These characters were also designed by me, and done completely in Illustrator. Some were for avatar concepts and others like the germ were created as villains in a game about the importance of clean water. <br/><br/> These were centered around a simplistic cell shaded look, meant to be fun and practical but hopefully marketable. <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/></p>
           <p class="pic_descr">More characters from the world of Mischiffs and a few just to show some variety and styles. The young girl was taken from an avatar builder idea I had and art directed that was meant to create characters that were along the lines of United Colors of Benetton. A more ambiguous take on culture and race that I will show more of later on. She in particualar was done all in Photoshop, where the others were strictly Illustrator. <br/><br/> 2 more Mischiffs made it with the UpGrader and Abrcadabra Mischiff. The other two are more of a generic monster I did for some marketing concepts.<br/><br/> </p>
         <p class="pic_descr">More characters, All done in Illustrator (well, with one handrawn to show part of the process. I often start with hand drawn images and scan them in.). <br/><br/> <br/><br/> We have from left to right, Choo Choo Nano, a nano robot doctor, GrassHopper Ninja who is a Mischiff and will eliminate Good Knights from protecting players. Then when have Grrrl! who was part of a t-shirt design. the characters at the bottom were for a monster mash game and were supposed to be collectables.<br/><br/> </p>
         <p class="pic_descr"> Some pen and Ink sketches as well as a Illustrator logo that was for something called the "cat club". <br/><br/> I actually like hard dsigns like this because of their strong perception to the veiwer. You often see this style in propaganda posters or for the war effort. Its very martial no matter what the subject matter. Of course everyone loves baby dragons, so there you go. And a Fu Dog for good measure. <br/><br/> <br/><br/> </p>
           <p class="pic_descr">These characters were designed as a branding excersize and were part of an avatar system design. This is going back the Colors of Benetton idea and trying to create a type of homogeny among race and culture with the look and feel of the characters<br/><br/> It is of the arguement that people will choose the ideal over the real in a virtual world, so all body types were essentially the same. This also helped make development easier also. ;) <br/><br/> These characters were actually taken from the system and basically printed out </p>
           <p class="pic_descr">A few of the logos I have done in the past. If you know anything about the process of making logos, it is an iterative and exhausting process. Hundreds of versions get made, but only a few see the light of day.<br/><br/>  Depending on the client, you can get a very broad spectrum of ideas before one path gets settled on. Logos can be metephoric or very literal, depending on taste, purpose and intention of use. These fall under a more literal for the most part, but people were happy with them.<br/><br/></p>
         <p class="pic_descr">These were marketing images for two different ideas for a mobile game I designed. The pitch was that the mechanic be a breakout type of action where one scenario was you played a monster and the ball was your familiar. You could choose both at the beginning of the game and unlock new ones (or buy) as you progressed through the game.<br/><br/> The second scenario was that you were a nano-bot eliminating viruses from different computer hardrives, all the way from home PC's to military computers.<br/><br/></p>
          <p class="pic_descr">This was a background image made for a level progression screen. Unfortunately the level was cut, so this was never actually used. I blocked just about everything out using a 3D program and then extensively touched it up in Photoshop til we achieved the desired effect. <br/><br/>A lot of times we would use tecniques of textureing right on top of 2d image to save time in rendering and creation. Spending to much time in 3d whne your result is 2d anyway is counter productive.<br/><br/></p>
         <p class="pic_descr">This was a title screen for one of the products I was designing and making while at Social Planet. It was designed to be a high res print and was created mostly in photoshop. <br/><br/> I drew the central figure of the woman by hand and laid out the other elements how I roughly wanted them, but from there it was all painting and rendering in photoshop. I went through at least 20 iterations before finally ending up with this classic theme inspired by the matrix. In all it took me a week to go from concept to this version.<br/><br/> </p>
         <p class="pic_descr">These two images were created as a pitch for a musical rythm game to Quaker Oats. <br/><br/> There were supposed to be multiple stages the player leveled up to, and each one had to have its own look and feel. These were all done with Illustrator using mostly just the pen tool. <br/><br/> </p>
         <p class="pic_descr">This was an animated scene going from Environmental devastation to a lush healthy environment. It was created as a splash screen for a mini-game whose theme was about raising awareness for environmentalism. It was designed and rendered almost completely in photoshop, with a few elements being made in Illustrator and then layered in.<br/><br/> The point of the project was to bring a dark sinsiter feel to the earth being exploited for its resources without a care of the repurcussions for all living beings.</p>
