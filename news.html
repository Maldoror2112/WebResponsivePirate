  	<p class="pStrong" id="a1InsideText">My name is <strong>Doug Hauger</strong> and I am a designer who codes. I have been working 
    intensely in JS/Jquery/Web responsive design for around a year now and am loving the challenge of it. I guess that describes me pretty well. I love 
    challenges. And codeing is a lot like a puzzle that needs to be solved. With every tool you learn, you have more knowledge to solve that puzzle. My 
    background is in Games, but beleive it or not, game UI is a lot like Web UI and knowing what it is to have great user interaction is just as important.
    We used to call it a "shell". Now its a "web app" or "web page". I definitely see gaming and the web becoming more as one as we progress to the future.
