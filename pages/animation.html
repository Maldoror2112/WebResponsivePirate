  	<p><article class ="pStrong" >These animations were created for a social web platform that allowed users to use collectable characters called
    Mischiff's on each other. This allowed them to maneuver up and down the leaderboard during tournaments. The reason why the backgrounds are
    the color they are is because each Mischiff was based on a rarity index. Red was the rarest, green was the most common. the actual character you see
    (sometimes red, sometimes purple) was that color to signify if the Mischiff was used on another player or the actual player itself. Purple
    meant it was the actual player, red meant it was being used on other players. the blue characters in the Follow the Leader buff should be red
    but I have not re-rendered them yet.</article></p>
