  	<p class="a1h2">Whats so great about Unity?</p>
  	<p class="pStrong" id="a1InsideText">I have been following Unity for awhile now and must say it is one of the most awesome tools out there
     for app and gaming develoment. It not only frees programmers from a lot  of the heavy lifting but empowers designers to be creative with 
     tech.<br><br> Unity is a cross-platform game engine with a built-in IDE developed by Unity Technologies. It is used to develop video games 
     for web plugins, desktop platforms, consoles and mobile devices. It grew from an OS X supported game development tool in 2005 to a multi-platform 
     game engine. The latest update, Unity 4.2.2, was released October 2013.

      	<strong> Unity currently supports development for iOS, Android, Windows, BlackBerry 10, OS X, Linux, web browsers, Flash, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows Phone 8, and Wii U. Two versions of the game engine are available for download, Unity and Unity Pro.   </br> </br>  <strong>Renderer:</strong></br>The graphics engine uses Direct3D (Windows, Xbox 360), OpenGL (Mac, Windows, Linux, PS3), OpenGL ES (Android, iOS), and proprietary APIs (Wii). There is support for bump mapping, reflection mapping, parallax mapping, screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO), dynamic shadows using shadow maps, render-to-texture and full-screen post-processing effects. Unity supports art assets and file formats from 3ds Max, Maya, Softimage, Blender, modo, ZBrush, Cinema 4D, Cheetah3D, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Fireworks and Allegorithmic Substance. </br> These assets can be added to the game project, and managed through Unity's graphical user interface. The ShaderLab language is used for shaders, supporting both declarative 'programming' of the fixed-function pipeline and shader programs written in GLSL or Cg. A shader can include multiple variants and a declarative fallback specification, allowing Unity to detect the best variant for the current video card, and if none are compatible, fall back to an alternative shader that may sacrifice features for performance. </br> </br>As of August 3rd, 2013, with the release of 4.2, Unity allows Indie developers to use Realtime shadows only for Directional lights, also the support of DirectX11 is added, which gives shadows a more pixel perfect resolution, textures to create 3d objects from grayscale, more facial graphics, smoother animations and a boost to the FPS.</br> </br><strong>Scripting:</strong></br> The game engine's scripting is built on Mono 2.6, the open-source implementation of the .NET Framework. Programmers can use UnityScript (a custom language with ECMAScript-inspired syntax, referred to as JavaScript by the software), C#, or Boo (which has a Python-inspired syntax). Starting with the 3.0 release, Unity ships with a customized version of MonoDevelop for debugging scripts.</br><strong>Asset Tracking:</strong></br> Unity also includes the Unity Asset Server - a version control solution for the developer's game assets and scripts. It uses PostgreSQL as a backend, an audio system built on the FMOD library (with ability to playback Ogg Vorbis compressed audio), video playback using the Theora codec, a terrain and vegetation engine (which supports tree billboarding, Occlusion Culling with Umbra), built-in lightmapping and global illumination with Beast, multiplayer networking using RakNet, and built-in pathfinding navigation meshes.</strong>
