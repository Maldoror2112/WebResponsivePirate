		<h2> Example UI/UX designs? This site for one!</h2>
        <p>
        <article class="pStrong">That's right. This site is an example of utilizing HTML5/JS/jQuery/AJAX and some of my latest UI/UX philosophies. The few things I plan on 
        fixing but that are not working how I would like are:<br><br>
        
        	<strong> 1.</strong> When user zooms into strictly gallery mode, swipe left and right do not work on mobile devices. This is largely because it seems fancybox does not support it. 
            If I cannot find an elegant solution there, I will need to find another library that can. I love the fact that everything works brilliantly on the desktop 
            (Even swipe left and right!!!), But who views the internet on their laptop/desktop anymore? (I know a few do, but i think you get the gist). 
            You guys need to support swipe features or you will have lost my support.<br><br>
            <strong> 2.</strong>My loading cues are not very helpful or are not all working consistantly. I need them to show up in the middle of the screen on whatever 
            device exists, in portrait or landscape mode, and to have timeouts and error messages telling the user why something is not loading. This is all AJAX setup and
             testing, so I know what to do, but it is a C bug at best for me right.<br><br>
             3. Asthetically I want the loading cues to be more in alignment with the art direction, like making them from stopwatches, but that is a low priority to content right 
             now. There are other asthetic issues that are obvious, but small, so I won't be getting into them for now (some of the font alighnments/padding are off on certain modes/devices).

		<h2> Social Planet sign up sheet</h2>

        <p>
        <article class="pStrong">This was just supposed to be a sign up sheet explaining what Social Planet was supposed to be about. Right now I only have the main front 
        page and not any of the contact, FAQ or other links completed. This one is completely set up for responsive design and works on my Samsung S2 and Nook tablet
        pretty well. <br><br><br><br> I ran into some problems using tables while trying to create a responsive design. Not sure if it is a flaw with semantic elements 
         or not, but it seems like table elements are extremely hard to control. Have not found anything online yet, but instead of using semantic 
         tables I will be using normal div elements to seperate my content and keep it controllable. <br><br><br><br> One other thing of note, I created the video from scratch. I edited in Premier and used After Effects to create some of the motion 
         graphics. Other tactics were largely using screengrabs of gameplay from past games I had worked on with various vendors. any other high res assets like the 
         facebook pages were created in Photoshop and dropped in. It took over 2 weeks to get it to this state, and I would like to revisit the motion graphics aspect
         to make it sexier.

		<h2>Social Planet social media site</h2>

        <p>
        <article class="pStrong">
        This was preliminary design made for a social site that was to be called Social Planet. When I first did it we were looking at how best to implement features
        and figure out the best layout which proved to be challenging. We had another iteration where the drop down menus were made into a list style on the right
        hand side of the page, but no one could agree on if that was the best use of real estate. It was a UI/UX chalenge for sure. 
         <br><br><br><br> I personally found the first versions (like this one) to be very clunky. I would have used the white space more effectively by hiding/unhideing elements selectively. But that would have added to the design 
        challenge and schedule and we ran out that runway pretty early. There is not much coding in JS/Jquery here. Most of the work involved CSS layout and then we were going to go from there with deciding some of 
         the interactions. I only have most links working to other pages.<br><br><br><br> This particular site has not been set for being fully web responsive. We figured with 
         all the features needed we would need to design a seperate mobile one to make sure our focal features were prevalent for that medium and that is where
         we would be using quite a bit of Jquery to selectively hide and unhide features as the user needed them. There was a lot of dynamic AJAX content that was going to be 
         loaded in all panels, so there was a lot to think about.

		<h2>Homemade Video Player</h2>
         <a href="http://dougtv.freakytikiproductions.com/" target="_blank"><img class="articleUIimage" src="../images/gallery/UI/VideoPlayer.png"/></a> 
        <p>  
        <article class="pStrong">    
        This was created because I thought it would be great to create a custom video player and play with the HTML 5 video API. this was done entirely in 
        JavaScript (No jQuery) and in hindsight I would not do that again.  
         <br><br><br><br> 
         But it was a good excersize in helping learn the language and its quirks. The player is not web responsive yet and I want to get a scroll feature 
         working, but I am contemplating on how cool anyone is going to think it is with all the existing features and libraries that are already out there.
          <br><br><br><br> This should be looked at as more of a design example and a work in progress until I figure out what want to do with it. I do plan 
          on getting it web responsive as I think the design will work well once I finish fleshing that out also.

       		A Steam Punk like interface I made some time ago. I wanted to create a cool gamer like HUD for my portfolio work and this is what transpired. 
            It's very mechanical and organic in comparison to the minimalist style that is in vogue right now, but I think it still shows some design 
            chops. Even the interface I tried to get a feeling of analog vs digital. Warning- Its a flash site, so it will probably only work on your 
            desktop devices

		<h2>Games For Good Facebook Application</h2>
        <a href="http://gfg.freakytikiproductions.com/" target="_blank"><img class="articleUIimage" src="../images/gallery/UI/GFG.png"/></a>
        <p>

        This was one of the larger and more ambitious projects I tried to do recently. It involved a system where people could create their own tournaments
        and invite their friends to the tournaments through facebook connect and then raise money for whatver cause they selected (Either a featured one that we 
        highlighted or one they could select from our database). This was an early wireframe I created to show the player flow of how they would add, remove and
        play in game tournaments.
         <br><br><br><br> 
        	It was designed to plug in any existing game engines that we could license or find. At the time Flash games were relatively easy to get and as long as
            we could plug in our leaderboard API, it would work with our system.
          <br><br><br><br> 
          We all know what has happened to flash and it goes without saying that our product got caught in the malestrom. Maybe one day it will be revived
          in HTML 5 with Unity and HTML 5 games along with it.
