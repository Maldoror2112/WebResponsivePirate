		<h2> Social Planet sign up sheet</h2>
        <p>
        <article class="pStrong"><a href="http://socialplanetsignup.freakytikiproductions.com/" target="_blank"><img src="../images/gallery/UI/SPSignUp.png"/></a>This was just supposed to be a sign up sheet explaining what Social Planet was supposed to be about. Right now I only have the main front 
        page and not any of the contact, FAQ or other links completed. This one is completely set up for responsive design and works on my Samsung S2 and Nook tablet
        pretty well. <br><br><br><br> I ran into some problems using tables while trying to create a responsive design. Not sure if it is a flaw with semantic elements 
         or not, but it seems like table elements are extremely hard to control. Have not found anything online yet, but instead of using semantic 
         tables I will be using normal div elements to seperate my content and keep it controllable. <br><br><br><br> One other thing of note, I created the video from scratch. I edited in Premier and used After Effects to create some of the motion 
         graphics. Other tactics were largely using screengrabs of gameplay from past games I had worked on with various vendors. any other high res assets like the 
         facebook pages were created in Photoshop and dropped in. It took over 2 weeks to get it to this state, and I would like to revisit the motion graphics aspect
         to make it sexier.
