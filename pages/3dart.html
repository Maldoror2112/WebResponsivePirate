      <p class="pic_descr">This was the texture for the Goliath model. I used tons of layers properties to get the metal looking old and rusted and pockmarked
      from battle damage. As the layer says its 1024 X 1024. There were also ambient occlusion maps and normal maps made for this that I wont display for space 
      reasons, but they are available upon request. This was fully made to a next gen model.<br/><br/> 
      </p>
      
      <p class="pic_descr"> Three quarter veiw of the model that was made for an X-box live game that was to be a "rugby meets demolition derby" type of game. The 
      name of this "hover craft" was called Goliath. It was meant to be a heavy craft, able to take and deal lots of damage but not very maneuverable. It's relatively
      low poly at 2415 faces and used simple primitives to create. Its texture was 1024 x 1024 and created from scratch in photoshop. This can also be seen in the modeling 
      demo video below.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>
      </p>
      
      <p class="pic_descr"> Rear veiw of the model that was made for an X-box live game that had elements of Smugglers Run incorporated into it. It was sci fi sports
      title where you had to score goals with your hover craft, while avoiding too much damage to your vehicle. It's relatively low poly at 2415 faces and used 
      simple primitives to create. Its texture was 1024 x 1024 and created from scratch in photoshop. This can also be seen in the modeling demo video below.<br/><br/>

      <p class="pic_descr"> There were no textures used on this bee character. The fur was able to simulate all the depth and shadow needed to make it believable.
      It appeared in everything from Army Men Air Attack cinematics to the cover of GamePro magazine. Shag fur was the plugin used for making the fur, but beyond that 
      it was standard face extrude modeling. This character was a big hit for the marketing department #DO at as they used it in just about everything. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>
