      <p class="pic_descr">These characters were designed as a branding excersize and were part of our monetization strategy. Players could buy these characters called "Mischiffs" and use them on tournament leaderboards, essentially against as well as to help other players move up in rank on the leaderboard. The design centered around players "feeding" their characters munchies (that they paid for) and then being able to use them to knock other players down a few ranks or boost their friends up a few ranks to win. These were all done in Illustrator and are vector graphics<br/><br/> These characters from top left to right are: Back to School (Disables the ability to use Level Up Mischiffs for the duration of a tournament), Knight Mirror (Protects you from all attack Mischiffs for the duration of a tournament), and Slots a Lot (earned you free Mischiffs when you won him in game)
      </p>
      
      <p class="pic_descr">These characters were also called "Mischiffs" and the same premise applies to them. They were essentially used as boosts or power ups to gameify the leaderboard. These were all done in Illustrator and are vector graphics <br/><br/> These characters from top left to right are: Giesha Pointastic (Gives a percentage of the players total points and add it back to the players total), Sophisticat (Takes you up the leaderboard a certain number of levels), Trade Master (Take any 2 Mischiffs that are the same and trade them in for one of higher rarity) and Good Knight (Protects player once against an attack)

      <p class="pic_descr">These characters were also designed by me, and done completely in Illustrator. Some were for avatar concepts and others like the germ were created as villains in a game about the importance of clean water. <br/><br/> These were centered around a simplistic cell shaded look, meant to be fun and practical but hopefully marketable. <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>
