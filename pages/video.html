  	<p><article class ="pStrong" >This was a sales video I made for the last endeavor I worked on. It was made to help promote and explain
    what it was that our product did. We were able to raise more money with it and it definitely helped explain what it was we were trying
    to do, ironically it also helped the team see the vision more than any document I could have written. This was one of those scenarios
    where I realized that being able to communicate the idea no matter what the medium was the most important thing. This video helped us 
    focus and see that vision even more. It was also going to be used as a promotional device on you tube when the time came and we finalized
    the look and feel of the product.</article></p>

  	<p><article class ="pStrong" >This was a movie I made around 8 years ago. I directed, storyboarded, edited and did most of the special 
effects for it. Worked a little bit on the script, but most of that can be attributed to our producr who worked on this. Over 30 people took 
part with no budget at all. Logistically, a nightmare. Historically, something none of us who worked on it will ever forget. It took around a 
year and a half to fully complete, and when it was it was a great relief. (insert smiley face here)</article></p>
