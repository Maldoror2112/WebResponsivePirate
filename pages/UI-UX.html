  	<p class="pStrong" id="a1InsideText">
    In all my perusings on the web I have found some great content and blurbs about what UX is. Largely due to my own questions
    and the answers I have receieved from others in the industry and companies out there who are using this discipline, as well
    as my own experiments and tests to see how users would behave, I have come up with my own list of references. It's all pretty 
    simple when you get down to it, but the voodoo is still largely "how" and what does the disciplne need as far as skills to do it.

     <h2 id="a2h2"> The 5 steps to UX, and yes UI is one of them!!</h2>
      	Stage 1 - One of the most mystical aspects and most misunderstood about what everyone calls UX is that a strategy has to be formed before going 
        forward with anything else. UX is such a buzzword these days that it is used without knowing fully what it means. The strategy part of UX design means 
        gathering as much information about your product as possible before going into the more concrete aspects of the design. We’ll use a “buy your friends 
        a beer app” to help follow along with the processes.<br><br>
        A part of the mystique is that every company is different and is possibly at a different stage of the process. I talked with one company who had 
        already had a product out there for a few years so they had already had data on their users and the type of users. They even had “names” for their 
        different types of users. They had their “personas” and didn’t even know it. <br><br>
        To me getting data such as the personas is the most nebulous aspect of the process and one that requires a lot of thought and inaction. I have heard many 
        methods of how to gather this information from requesting users on Craigslist  to sending out surveys to gather information.<br><br>
        I’ll tell ya, that is a lot of work in itself, and I think the info you can get back from it is suspect in itself. I’m no expert on this, but I have found 
        just being a friendly face and going up to someone at a relatively quiet coffee shop, who may fit a demographic you are looking for and offering an incentive 
        (“Hey can I offer to pay for your meal if you help us with 5 minutes of your time…”  or “Can we offer you a $20 gift card from this coffee shop for 5 minutes 
        of your time in answering a few questions…” , etc).<br><br>
        Bottom line is, this is the stage where you get most of your information from your stakeholders (CEO, Marketing, investors, etc) and counter that with the 
        info you get from prospective users. The important thing to do is ask the right questions to get you closer to the right UX before that UX is even built. That
         is one of the hardest things to do and one that I think requires the entire team (company). For our beer app one of the needs of the user would be “fewest 
         steps possible to buy a beer for my freind”. <br><br> 
         
         One of the questions to ask may be “If you could by your friend a real beer through our app, what would be more important? Being able to select the exact beer,
         or pay a set price for a range of beers and let your friend select?” The CEO would have their own requirements like being able to make money transactions 
         easily and creating incentives for bars using the app. A few of the more important elements that others have told me and I have learned from doing are:
        <ol>
        <li>Nail your objectives during this stage</li>
        <li>Define your business needs</li>
        <li>Think about your branding and what that does for the product</li>
        <li>What are the Personas and User needs. Do your User research now as much as possible</li>
        <li>Do your research on any competition out there.</li>
        </ol>

        This is where you take all that information and start to formulate it into priorities. From here you would measure what your user 
        information says about what features will be the most important as well as needed. Your stakeholders will have stated their requirements of what they want 
        the product to do, now you need to design that around what the user likes to see or would want. These become your priorities.<br><br>
        You can keep your priorities around 4 basic principles which are Must, Should, Could and Would. Must is a HIGH priority feature that must be provided in the product. 
        Should is next set of priorities that are features you can get in if you can. Could, are features that are so low, nobody would really miss them if they weren’t in 
        there. Would, is what you would like to do in the future, or what features may be part of a future wish list.<br><br>
        
        It is here you can hopefully indentify your technical requirements and content needs. From here you know you are going to need the ability to have the user 
        transact the money to a participating bar. Things like are there any special libraries/products that are already doing these kinds of things (such as Qrest, Qcodes,
        Pay Pal, Fancy Box, Moustache, etc...). Or, what are we going to need to build ourselves? You know you will need to have the ability to store credit card data. 
        <br><br>
        Content would be something like “How are all the different beers going to be categorized”? or “How are users going to choose the beer they want to buy?”.

        This is  where things start to become tangible. You start to take all the info you have grouped together and see how they interact or connect with one another. 
        This is where you start to see how the pieces of the site fit together and behave. All you are doing here is flow diagrams , concept maps/models, you are 
        developing your language conventions all with nothing more than boxes and arrows like any boring flow diagram.<br><br>
        
        Let’s go back to our app that allows your friends to buy each other a beer at any participating bar. You need to give them the ability to select the bar, 
        then select the type of beer (Or beer group) and be able to notify their friend. That’s three different things that we would see grouped together in a flow 
        chart with connecting arrows showing how they interact with each other.

        	Blueprint of the product. This is essentially something as simple as a black and white layout that shows how users will interact with your product. How do 
            they enter our app? How do they select a beer? How do they pay for it? How does the bar get the transaction?

        	UI! Pretty pictures! Branding! color schemes and style guides oh my! This is the pixel perfect version that is looking like the final product. Its where you 
            finalize your logo and art direction and are creating the UI to reflect the brand that is your product.
         <br><br> 
             This is the part that everyone is familiar with and even though it has its own set of abstract principles (Art direction, color theory) it is one of the more 
             familiar terrains that people automatically associate with UX.  <br><br>
